One MiniMax H3 FL2VA video, generated cooperatively by two NVIDIA DGX Sparks.

**Credit:** the two-Spark recipe, vLLM-Omni Ray executor, image lineage, and
August 2026 public-release acceptance are [Joey Rodriguez / joeynyc](https://github.com/joeynyc/MiniMax-H3-2x-DGX-Spark).
This public fork keeps that work and documents GB10 CX7 RoCE bring-up so Ulysses
SP=2 actually uses IB instead of falling back to TCP.

This is a separate, experimental extension of the
[single-Spark recipe](https://github.com/joeynyc/MiniMax-H3-DGX-Spark). It
adds the network-capable diffusion executor that the pinned vLLM-Omni build
does not provide. Ray places one rank on each Spark; NCCL carries the tensor
collectives over the dedicated RoCEv2 link.

## Measured topology

| Role | Host | Fabric address | Distributed rank |
|---|---|---:|---:|
| Spark 1 / head/API | `spark-head` example | private fabric address | 0 |
| Spark 2 / peer | `spark-peer` example | private fabric address | 1 |

The DiT uses two-way Ulysses sequence parallelism. Both GPUs contribute to the
same denoising trajectory; rank 0 also owns the encoders, VAE, and final API
response.

## Verified results

The final public-release acceptance ran on August 4, 2026 using the same
derived image on both nodes:
`sha256:09e6521356bbbb635048228d30e78a36c65352a48f7620c921d5aeff2d21b90b`
The first request after each cold start includes lazy regional compilation;
the second is the warm measurement.

| Profile | Ready from cold | Compile warm-up | Warm request |
|---|---:|---:|---:|
| cuDNN + regional compile, full compute | 588.98 s | 70.337 s | 46.574 s |
| cuDNN + regional compile, balanced Cache-DiT | 584.91 s | 55.412 s | 30.578 s |

All four fixed-input T2VA requests produced 56-frame, 768x448, 24 fps
H.264/AAC MP4 files. Complete FFmpeg decoding, non-silent audio, and midpoint
visual inspection passed. Both GPUs were active during generation, Ray reported
two healthy nodes, and all three containers remained at zero restarts with no
OOM state. The API and Ray dashboard listened only on the configured private
head address.

Earlier matched tests established the broader performance and quality results:

- The first distributed acceptance completed in 68.783 and 64.888 seconds,
  versus 154.956 seconds for the comparable single-Spark request—about 2.3x
  faster client-side.
- cuDNN attention plus regional compilation averaged 48.689 seconds warm,
  24.2% faster than the 64.226-second warm Torch-SDPA/eager baseline.
- The 1344x768, 50-step full-compute workload fell from 2,281.532 to
  1,353.506 seconds. The output fully decoded and measured 0.9134 video SSIM
  against the earlier same-seed result.
- The balanced Cache-DiT profile completed that same workload in 608.991
  seconds—55.0% lower latency and 2.22x the generation rate of full compute.
  Its same-seed output measured 0.888 SSIM and 27.04 dB average video PSNR
  against full compute, with effectively unchanged audio.

These are measured results from one two-machine lab, not vendor benchmarks or
upstream support guarantees. Cache-DiT is a visually inspected speed/quality
tradeoff, not a lossless mode. See
[the complete acceptance record](docs/RESULTS.md) for request settings, hashes,
quality observations, and experimental limits.

### GB10 CX7 RoCE (this fork, 2026-09-04)

On a later GB10 pair, Socket TCP made two-Spark Ulysses ~1-GPU latency
(~90.5 s for the same 20-step 768×448 eager clip). Host `ib_write_bw` was
already ~109 Gb/s. GPU NCCL failed until:

1. IPv4-mapped RoCEv2 **GID index 3** (not fe80 index 1) with `NCCL_IB_ADDR_FAMILY=AF_INET`
2. **Matched netdev MTU 1500** on both nodes (9000 vs 1500 → mlx 4096 vs 1024 → `IBV_WC_REM_INV_REQ_ERR`)
3. Docker **`--ulimit memlock=-1`** (8 MiB default produced garbage RDMA lengths)
4. `NCCL_IB_MTU=1024` to match mlx `active_mtu`
5. `NCCL_DEBUG=WARN` (`INFO` filled the Ray worker log pipe and killed the actor after denoise)

Measured CUDNN eager, no Cache-DiT, seed 42, 768×448, 56 frames, 20 steps:

| Transport | Warm client | SHA vs Socket eager |
|---|---:|---|
| Socket TCP | 90.5 s | reference |
| RoCE IB | **55.5 s** (repeat 58.4 s) | **identical** (SSIM 1.0) |

See [docs/ROCE-GB10.md](docs/ROCE-GB10.md). Joey's August 4 acceptance (~46.6 s compile warm on working RoCE) remains the original published number; this fork's 55.5 s is eager on this pair after the fabric was actually using IB.

## How one video spans both machines

```text
client -> Spark 1 API -> Ray executor
                         |-- rank 0 / Spark 1 / cuda:0 --\
                         |                               | Ulysses SP + NCCL/RoCE
                         `-- rank 1 / Spark 2 / cuda:0 --/
                                      |
                              rank 0 encodes MP4 -> client
```

This is model parallelism, not two independent jobs: every denoising step is
split across the two ranks.

## Prerequisites

- Two ARM64 DGX Sparks with the FL2VA checkpoint available at the same absolute
  path on both nodes.
- Passwordless SSH aliases for the head and peer.
- The dedicated fabric addresses, interface, RoCE HCA, and live GID index for
  each node. Do not assume both nodes use the same GID index after reboot.
- Docker with GPU and `/dev/infiniband` access.
- The known-good `minimax-h3-dgx-spark:sm121-fp8` base image from the
  single-Spark project on the head.
- Authorization to use MiniMax H3 in your territory.

The checkpoint and base image are not redistributed here. Paths, hosts,
addresses, ports, interface, HCA, and GID are configurable in `.env`; the
example uses non-routable documentation addresses that must be replaced.

## Quick start

```bash
git clone https://github.com/joeynyc/MiniMax-H3-2x-DGX-Spark.git
cd MiniMax-H3-2x-DGX-Spark
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env: both hosts, fabric, shared paths, and license acknowledgement.

make audit
make build
./scripts/start-two-sparks.sh
./scripts/wait-ready.sh
make status
```

Build the `minimax-h3-dgx-spark:sm121-fp8` base image first by following the
[single-Spark repository](https://github.com/joeynyc/MiniMax-H3-DGX-Spark).
`make build` then transfers the derived two-node image to the peer and refuses
to continue unless the accepted base lineage, runtime versions, and both
derived image IDs match. The accepted companion commit, upstream digest, local
base image ID, and exact runtime package versions are recorded in
[the reproducibility guide](docs/REPRODUCIBILITY.md).

Cold readiness measured 584.91 to 588.98 seconds in the final acceptance.
`wait-ready.sh` waits through model loading and then checks both Ray nodes,
HTTP health, all three containers, and exact model identity. The API is served
only on the configured private head-node address on port `8000`; synchronous
generation uses `POST /v1/videos/sync`.

The default fast profile compiles lazily. Treat the first successful request
after a cold start as warm-up and measure steady-state latency from the second
request onward.

The default launcher keeps cross-step caching off for maximum fidelity. To
start the measured balanced Cache-DiT profile instead:

```bash
./scripts/start-cache-dit-profile.sh
./scripts/wait-ready.sh
```

Run `./scripts/start-two-sparks.sh` to return to the no-cache profile. Both
launchers replace only this experiment's three containers; model data and
benchmark artifacts are preserved.

Only where the model license permits generation and display:

```bash
make smoke
make verify
```

Stop only this experiment with:

```bash
make down
```

The known-good single-Spark deployment is not modified by this repository.

## Experimental boundaries

- The custom executor is deliberately pinned to exactly two one-GPU hosts.
- It has been accepted for synchronous, batch-size-one FL2VA generation, not
  concurrent production traffic or arbitrary diffusion models.
- The API/head rank uses more memory because the encoders and output path are
  not evenly sharded.
- Fixed-seed decoded midpoint frames matched exactly across the two accepted
  runs. MP4 byte hashes differed because the encoded container differed by
  eight bytes, so this is not claimed as bit-for-bit MP4 determinism.
- The accepted cuDNN/compiled profile is deterministic across its measured warm
  runs, but changing attention backends changes the numerical trajectory and
  can change the sampled scene for the same seed.
- Cache-DiT reuses block residuals across selected denoising steps. It is
  deterministic in the measured warm runs but intentionally changes pixels;
  use the default no-cache launcher when exact full-compute fidelity matters.
- This patches an internal vLLM-Omni executor hook and should be revalidated
  against every upstream image change.
- Ray, its dashboard, the API, and dynamic worker traffic use host networking
  without authentication. The dashboard and API bind only to the configured
  head fabric address; the remaining distributed ports still require mutually
  trusted, firewalled nodes. See [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md).

## Reproducibility language

“Reproducible” here means the documented topology repeatedly started, both
ranks performed one generation, and the output passed the same media checks.
It does not mean byte-identical MP4 output, compatibility with arbitrary
hardware, or an upstream-supported multi-node H3 configuration.
