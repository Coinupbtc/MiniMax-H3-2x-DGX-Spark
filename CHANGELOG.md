# Changelog

## Unreleased

- One-Spark quality proof (2026-09-05): same seed-42 768×448 20-step clip on
  one GB10 with CUDNN eager / no Cache-DiT is SHA-identical to the two-Spark IB
  file (`2d5e3d38…`, SSIM 1.0) at 136.1 s (~2.45× the 55.5 s IB pair). The
  published `sm121-fp8` image hardcodes `TORCH_SDPA` (SSIM 0.72). Compose
  compile remains a different picture (SSIM 0.71). Table: `docs/quality-speed.md`.
- GB10 CX7 RoCE bring-up (2026-09-04): IPv4-mapped GID index 3, matched fabric
  MTU 1500 / mlx active_mtu 1024, Docker `--ulimit memlock=-1`, `NCCL_IB_MTU=1024`,
  `NCCL_GIN_ENABLE=0`, and `NCCL_DEBUG=WARN`. Socket TCP is the fallback, not
  the default. On this pair, CUDNN eager no-cache 768×448 20-step T2VA went from
  90.5 s over Socket to 55.5 s over IB with a SHA-identical MP4 (SSIM 1.0).
  `NCCL_DEBUG=INFO` filled the Ray worker log pipe and killed the actor mid-clip.
- Added `scripts/align-fabric-mtu.py` so start-two-sparks can ioctl both nodes
  to 1500 without host sudo (NET_ADMIN host-net container).
- Added `scripts/start-full-compute-profile.sh` (no Cache-DiT) and quality-speed
  bench/SSIM helpers.

- Repeated the complete live public-release acceptance on both Sparks using the
  branch-built image ID
  `sha256:09e6521356bbbb635048228d30e78a36c65352a48f7620c921d5aeff2d21b90b`.
  The default full-compute profile became ready in 588.98 seconds and completed
  compile-warm-up and warm T2VA requests in 70.337 and 46.574 seconds. The
  balanced Cache-DiT profile became ready in 584.91 seconds and completed the
  same requests in 55.412 and 30.578 seconds. All four outputs passed complete
  FFmpeg decoding as H.264/AAC MP4 files; these release measurements do not
  replace the previously published matched 50-step benchmark results.
- Bound the unauthenticated H3 API and Ray dashboard to the configured private
  head fabric address instead of every host interface.
- Replaced internal lab host identities in public examples with generic
  `spark-head` and `spark-peer` placeholders.
- Recorded and enforced the accepted upstream image digest, companion commit,
  local base image ID, ARM64 lineage, and measured runtime version set.
- Added opt-in Cache-DiT launch controls and a measured balanced profile using
  threshold 0.15, four full-compute warm-up steps, no TaylorSeer, and a
  one-step cache ceiling. The default launcher remains no-cache.
- The balanced profile reduced the matched 1344x768, 50-step request from
  1,353.506 to 608.991 seconds (55.0% lower latency, 2.22x generation rate).
  Full decode and multi-frame inspection passed; same-seed video measured
  0.888 SSIM and 27.04 dB PSNR against full compute.
- Made IPv4 RoCEv2 GID selection node-specific so a peer reboot cannot make Ray
  propagate the head node's now-invalid GID index to both diffusion actors.
- Added configurable Torch-SDPA, cuDNN, and FlashAttention diffusion backends,
  configurable eager/compiled execution, readiness waiting, and fixed-input
  benchmark tooling.
- Promoted cuDNN attention plus regional compilation after two final warm runs
  averaged 48.689 seconds, 24.2% faster than the 64.226-second warm baseline.
  FlashAttention 4 was rejected after an SM121 CuTe/CUTLASS JIT failure.
- Repeated the earlier same-seed 1344x768, 50-step, four-second quality request
  with the accepted profile. End-to-end time fell from 2,281.532 to 1,353.506
  seconds (40.7% lower latency, 1.69x generation rate); full media decode and
  multi-frame visual inspection passed.
- Added public-release documentation, model-license warning, security policy,
  contributor guidance, output verification, automated audit, and CI.

## 1.0.0 - 2026-08-03

- Added a Ray-backed two-host diffusion executor for the pinned MiniMax H3
  FL2VA vLLM-Omni stack.
- Added fail-closed two-Spark launch, status, stop, NCCL, and T2VA acceptance
  tooling.
- Recorded two successful one-video runs using Ulysses sequence parallelism
  and NCCL over RoCEv2.
